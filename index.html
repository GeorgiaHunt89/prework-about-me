      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently run my own career consulting and recruitment firm while I finish my MBA an a coding boot camp at The University of Adelaide. I have to children, Levi, he turned 4 in January and Piper, who will turn 2 in March.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Adelaide, born and raised.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to read, hike, play netball and cook.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love the opportunity to become a software developer for the defence force</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently moved back to the Adelaide Hills after living by the beach in Adelaide's South for 10 years.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have had the chance to play around with coding before and had a ball but I always thought that without a computer science degree it was out of my realm of possibility. I am both extremely creative and analytical so I feel that I could really excel at Software Development.</p>
